    <h2 class="section-title">The Reason For My Design Statement 
</h2>
    <ul class="design-list">
     <li>As my final project, I wanted to create a diabetes-friendly website to solve the problem of people not being able to get access to recipes that keep their blood sugar stable, that are healthy and easy to follow. After interviewing my family members and people I knew who are diabetic or have to watch their blood sugar levels, I discovered that a lot of them liked recipes that are fast to make due to their busy schedules. They believed cooking and eating should be viewed as an enjoyment, not a stressful task. However, they also wanted meals that are more nutritious and have flavor. Therefore, I've received a lot of recipes from the interviews, and selected a few to include in this website.</li>

      <li>I wanted to create this website to obtain recipes that are healthy, delicious, and fun to make for my viewers. To do this, I needed to make my website friendly while remaining organized and clean. This way, my viewers feel welcomed and are able to easily explore recipes. To begin, I chose my color palette to contain a variety of colors of green, pink, and white. This way, my website would symbolize prioritizing health while remaining calm and approachable to my viewers. The colors also don’t clash with each other, so my viewers are able to read the texts easily.</li>

      <li>Next, there is typography and the fluid type scale, for I wanted my texts to be readable. Therefore, I used “Montserrat” and “ABeeZee” to make my words legible and clear. The sizes, boldness, and location of the text also lead my viewers' eyes easily while emphasizing the importance of each context they look at.</li>

      <li>Then, the layout for my grid and the flex are created to make my pages not be cluttered and have space, allowing my viewers not to feel cramped when browsing my site. I also wanted to make my cards have a reaction for my recipes, making it easy to navigate.</li>

      <li>I made sure to include animations for my website. I wanted my recipes, their buttons, and the homepage buttons to do a little bounce animation as a response to the viewer hovering over them with their mouse to give my page a little charm. I also wanted to add an animation of my logo and have the tape stick out a bit at the corner of the screen. That way, my viewers will notice it, and when they hover the mouse over the logo, it will do an animation to make the logo glossy, going over like tape. I thought this would create a delightful surprise and fun experience for my viewers, making my site more enjoyable. The words in the navigation bar at the top and at the bottom of the footer changes color when hovered over. The email underneath the contact at the footer also changes color when hovered over. Finally, I wanted the background to have the light colored dots to move, as if they were floating, to make my website friendlier.</li>

      <li>Lastly, the credibility of the author, who is me, and contact information that will be located in the footer and the contact page. All content on my website is only for educational purposes and not to be seen as medical or professional advice or assistance.</li>
